I'm currently a master's student in applied mathematics major in mathematical finance at Ateneo de Manila University. My interests are broadly in the fields of Optimal Control, Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations, Stochastic Analysis, Algorithmic Problem Solving, as well as Financial Risk Management. Specific areas of interest and expertise include longevity risk management, optimal portfolio selection, algorithmic trading, affine term structure models, and market microstructure.

Please find my [CV](https://kenrickraymond.github.io/files/KENRICK_RAYMOND_SO_ACADEMIC_CV.pdf) (Version August 2024) here.

My interest in quantitative finance was sparked by the story of Jim Simons. Originally an academic in differential geometry, Simons changed the way society thought about financial markets through algorithmic problem solving. This story resonates with me because it points to the possibilities at the intersection of mathematics and finance. What fascinates me about quantitative finance is the dynamic and complex structure of financial markets. This intrinsic complexity fuels my curiosity - which feels like an intellectual treasure hunt that drives me to explore and understand the intricate details behind certain phenomena. 

Ultimately, I believe that quantitative finance has the potential to drive improvements in the current landscape of financial markets. For example, developing a framework for pricing standardized derivatives linked to the survival probability of a sample population to hedge pension funds' exposure to increased life expectancy. By translating abstract mathematical concepts into practical financial applications, I aim to contribute to a more efficient and equitable financial system.
