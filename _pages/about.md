I'm currently a master's student in applied mathematics major in mathematical finance at Ateneo de Manila University. My interests are broadly in the fields of Optimal Control, Numerical Solutions to Differential Equations, Stochastic Analysis, Algorithmic Problem Solving, as well as Financial Risk Management. Specific areas of interests and expertise include longevity risk management, optimal portfolio selection, algorithmic trading, affine term structure models, and market microstructure.

My interest in quantitative finance was sparked by the story of Jim Simons. Initially an academic in differential geometry, Simons leveraged his background in pure mathematics to revolutionize finance through algorithmic thinking.

What fascinates me about quantitative finance is the dynamic and complex structure of financial markets. This intrinsic complexity fuels my curiosity and drives me towards research to understand the intricate details behind certain phenomena. 

Ultimately, I believe that quantitative finance has the potential to drive improvements in the current landscape of financial markets. For example, devising a framework for pricing standardized derivatives linked to the survival probability of a sample population to hedge the exposure pension funds face to increased life expectancy. By relating abstract mathematical concepts into practical financial applications, I aim to contribute to a more efficient and equitable financial system.

In a past life, I also represented my country internationally in [Lion Dancing](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/kenrickraymond.github.io/blob/master/images/Malaysia.jpg)
