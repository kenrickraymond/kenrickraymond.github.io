Kenrick is an incoming **PhD researcher** at the Institute of Statistics, Biostatistics, and Actuarial Sciences at Université catholique de Louvain under the supervision of [Karim Barigou](https://karimbarigou.com/). **His research focuses on integrating climate risks into mortality and financial risk modeling for life insurance**. He aims to develop predictive models that incorporate climatic variables such as temperature, pollution, and precipitation. He also studies how these risks affect the financial stability of insurers and the design of innovative financial products, such as catastrophe (CAT) bonds, to help hedge against mortality fluctuations. 

Kenrick holds a master's degree in applied mathematics with a major in mathematical finance from Ateneo de Manila University. His background includes quantitative risk management, stochastic modeling, and developing mathematical tools to address uncertainty in finance and insurance. He is particularly interested in advanced mortality forecasting techniques and the application of neural networks to insurance valuation and hedging strategies.

Understanding and managing climate risks is becoming more important as environmental changes bring new and unpredictable challenges to financial security. Kenrick’s work aims to translate mathematical ideas into practical tools that can help insurers better prepare for these risks. By applying quantitative methods to real-world problems, he hopes to make a small contribution toward building a more resilient and fair financial system.

As life expectancy rises, pension plans face increasing longevity risk. Survivor contracts, a type of longevity-linked security, allow these plans to transfer risk to capital markets. However, there is still debate over the best mortality models and premium principles for pricing these contracts. This paper examines how different modeling choices affect the pricing and risk measurement of survivor contracts. We present a framework for evaluating risk using various mortality models and premium principles, and analyze their impact on key risk measures such as value-at-risk and expected shortfall. Our findings highlight the importance of refining both mortality models and premium principles to improve pricing accuracy and risk management. We also recommend that practitioners use expected shortfall alongside value-at-risk to better capture tail risks and guide capital allocation.
