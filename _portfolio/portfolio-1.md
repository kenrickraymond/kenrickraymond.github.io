title: "[Uncertainty in Pricing and Risk Measurement of Survivor Contracts](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Longevity-Instrument-Pricing)"
excerpt: "Longevity risk is a challenge for pension funds, as retirees may live longer than expected, leading to financial pressures. Traditionally, reinsurance has been used to transfer this risk, but recently there has been growing interest in transferring longevity risk through the capital markets via standardised securities such as survivor swaps. These contracts offer an alternative method of risk transfer, but face challenges due to the infancy of the longevity market and a lack of consensus on the best models for estimating survival rates or applying risk-neutral transformations. This project addresses these issues by examining the valuation of survivor swaps using four survival models and eight premium principles, providing comprehensive insights into pricing dynamics.

Beyond valuation, the research introduces a framework for calculating risk metrics for survivor contracts. With increasing interest in longevity risk management products, financial institutions need to assess potential losses to ensure appropriate capital allocation in line with regulatory standards such as [Solvency II](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/el/MEMO_15_3120). This project, conducted between early 2023 and mid-2024, used R for its analyses and provides valuable perspectives on risk management and financial sustainability in the evolving market for longevity risk products.

# "Longevity risk poses a challenge for pension funds â€” this risk refers to the uncertain possibility that retirees might live longer than anticipated, leading to unexpected financial strains. Traditionally, the transfer of this risk has relied on reinsurance. Recently, there is a growing interest in transferring longevity risk into capital markets through standardized securities such as survivor swaps. These contracts present an alternative method for risk transfer but also introduce some challenges due to the infancy of the market for longevity-linked products. One issue among the literature involves the lack of consensus regarding the appropriate models for determining survival rates, in addition to the determining the appropriate model for risk-neutral transformations. This project examines the impact on the valuation of survivor swaps using four survivor models along with eight premium principles. <br/><br/> Moreover, this paper goes further and present a framework for calculating risk metrics for the survivor contracts. Indeed, with the recent interest in standardized securities to transfer longevity risk, there is a need for financial institutions to evaluate possible losses to determine capital allocation in line with regulatory requirements (in this case, [Solvency II](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/el/MEMO_15_3120)). This project was accomplished early 2023 to mid 2024 using the programming language R. <br/><br/> A writing sample can be accessed [here](https://kenrickraymond.github.io/files/Risks_Journal_Submission.pdf).<br/>"
