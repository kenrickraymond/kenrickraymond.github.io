title: "[Uncertainty in Pricing and Risk Measurement of Survivor Contracts](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Longevity-Instrument-Pricing)"
excerpt: "Longevity risk refers to the risk that pensioners live for longer than pricing assumptions resulting in unanticipated losses for pension funds. While longevity risk is traditionally transferred through reinsurance, there is increasing interest in transferring this risk to capital markets through standardized securities such as survivor swaps. An issue arises because of the financial market for survivor-linked products is not as mature as traditional financial markets hence there is currently no consensus on the appropriate model for survival rates nor model for risk-neutral transformations. This project compares the behavior of four survivor models and eight premium principles and discusses the impact of these choices on the valuation of survivor swaps. <br/><br/> After discussing the valuation of survivor contracts, this paper goes further and present a framework for calculating risk metrics for the survivor contracts. Indeed, with the recent interest in standardized securities to transfer longevity risk, there is a need for financial institutions to evaluate possible losses to determine capital allocation in line with regulatory requirements (in this case, [Solvency II](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/el/MEMO_15_3120)). This project was accomplished early 2023 to mid 2024 using the programming language R. <br/>"
