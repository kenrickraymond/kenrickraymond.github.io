title: "[Uncertainty in Pricing and Risk Measurement of Survivor Contracts](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Longevity-Instrument-Pricing)"
excerpt: "Longevity risk is a challenge for pension funds, as retirees may live longer than expected, leading to financial pressures. Traditionally, reinsurance has been used to transfer this risk, but recently there has been growing interest in transferring longevity risk through the capital markets via standardised securities such as survivor swaps. These contracts offer an alternative method of risk transfer, but face challenges due to the infancy of the longevity market and a lack of consensus on the best models for estimating survival rates or applying risk-neutral transformations. This project addresses these issues by examining the valuation of survivor swaps using four survival models and eight premium principles, providing comprehensive insights into pricing dynamics.

Beyond valuation, the research introduces a framework for calculating risk metrics for survivor contracts. With increasing interest in longevity risk management products, financial institutions need to assess potential losses to ensure appropriate capital allocation in line with regulatory standards such as [Solvency II](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/el/MEMO_15_3120).
