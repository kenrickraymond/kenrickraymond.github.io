title: "[Uncertainty in Pricing and Risk Measurement of Survivor Contracts](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Longevity-Instrument-Pricing)"
excerpt: "Longevity risk poses a challenge for pension funds â€” this risk refers to the uncertain possibility that retirees might live longer than anticipated, leading to unexpected financial strains. Traditionally, the transfer of this risk has relied on reinsurance. Recently, there is a growing interest in transferring longevity risk into capital markets through standardized securities such as survivor swaps. These contracts present an alternative method for risk transfer but also introduce some challenges due to the infancy of the market for longevity-linked products. One issue among the literature involves the lack of consensus regarding the appropriate models for determining survival rates, in addition to the determining the appropriate model for risk-neutral transformations. This project examines the impact on the valuation of survivor swaps using four survivor models along with eight premium principles. <br/><br/> Moreover, this paper goes further and present a framework for calculating risk metrics for the survivor contracts. Indeed, with the recent interest in standardized securities to transfer longevity risk, there is a need for financial institutions to evaluate possible losses to determine capital allocation in line with regulatory requirements (in this case, [Solvency II](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/el/MEMO_15_3120)). This project was accomplished early 2023 to mid 2024 using the programming language R. <br/><br/> A writing sample can be accessed [here](https://kenrickraymond.github.io/files/Risks_Journal_Submission.pdf).<br/>"
