title: "Stacked Ensemble Machine Learning for Tax Fraud Detection <a href='https://kenrickraymond.github.io/files/Masters.pdf' target='_blank'>[PDF]</a> [[Github]](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Masters-Thesis 'target=\"_blank\"')"
excerpt: "This project explores how machine learning, specifically stacked ensemble models, can modernize tax fraud detection for the Philippine Bureau of Internal Revenue. Traditional manual reviews are often slow and may overlook subtle fraud patterns, so this study combines unsupervised methods like Isolation Forest and K-means clustering to group suspicious companies, followed by supervised models such as XGBoost and random forests to accurately identify the characteristics of fraudulent companies. The results demonstrate that this approach not only speeds up detection but also improves accuracy and scalability, providing an effective and practical solution for enhancing tax administration in the Philippines."
