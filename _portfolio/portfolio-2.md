title: "[Estimating a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Affine Term Structure Model Using the Kalman Filter](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Estimating-CIR-Model-Using-Kalman-Filter)"
excerpt: "The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model is a continuous-time, mean-reverting stochastic process that takes non-negative values. As such, the CIR model is a popular choice for modelling the term structure of interest rates. While negative interest rates are possible (e.g. government bonds in Japan and Switzerland) due to deflation (the currency appreciates, making consumer goods cheaper), most countries experience non-negative interest rates. The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that estimates model parameters by predicting, updating and correcting state variables. As a result, the Kalman filter separates the noise from the true desired value of a state variable. This project was carried out in mid-2024 using R.  <br/>"
