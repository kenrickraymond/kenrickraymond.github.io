title: "[Estimating a Cox-Ingersoll-Ross Affine Term Structure Model Using the Kalman Filter](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Estimating-CIR-Model-Using-Kalman-Filter)"
excerpt: "The Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model is a continuous-time mean-reverting stochastic process that takes on non-negative values. As such, the CIR model is a popular choice to model the term structure of interest rates. While negative interest rates are possible (For example, treasury bonds in Japan and Switzerland) due to deflation (the currency becomes stronger resulting in cheaper consumer goods), most countries experience non-negative interest rates. The Kalman filter is a recursive algorithm that estimates model parameters by predicting, updating, and correcting the state variables. As a result, the Kalman filter seperates the noise from the true desired value of a state variable. This project was done mid 2024 using R.  <br/>"
