title: "[Numerical Solution to the Optimal Portfolio Selection Problem for Power Utility Function](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Numerical-Solution-to-the-Optimal-Portfolio-Selection-Problem-for-Power-Utility-Function)"
excerpt: "The pioneering work in portfolio selection was attributed to [Markowitz (1952)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2975974). In this project, the goal is to determine the optimal asset weights in a portfolio consisting of a risk-free and a risky asset. In this scenario, the risky asset evolves according to the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. While the standard approach to portfolio selection involves maximizing the expected return and minimizing the variance, this project seeks to maximize a utility function that can be interpreted as the utility the investor derives from investing a larger portion in the risky asset instead of the risk-free asset. <br/><br/> The algorithm employed in this project employs the [maximal use of central diffferencing](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40233269). This means that the algorithm will choose central differencing as long as a criteria is satisfied, otherwise it would choose between forward or backward differences. This project was done mid 2023 using Python. <br/>"
