title: "[Numerical Solution to the Optimal Portfolio Selection Problem for Power Utility Function](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Numerical-Solution-to-the-Optimal-Portfolio-Selection-Problem-for-Power-Utility-Function)"
excerpt: "This project aims to determine the optimal asset weights in a portfolio consisting of a risk-free asset and a risky asset, where the risky asset follows an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. While traditional portfolio selection focuses on maximising expected return and minimising variance, this study seeks to maximise a utility function representing the investor's preference for holding more of the risky asset than the risk-free asset. The algorithm used in this project uses [central differencing](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40233269) as long as a specified criterion is met, switching to forward or backward differencing when necessary. The project was carried out in mid-2023 using Python. <br/>"
