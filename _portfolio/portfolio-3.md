excerpt: "This paper introduces a numerical method for solving the optimal portfolio selection problem in a financial market with two assets: a risk-free bond and a risky stock. The goal is to find an investment strategy that *maximizes the expected utility of terminal wealth*. The problem is modeled as a stochastic differential equation, which describes the evolution of the wealth process over time. The solution is approached by solving the *Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation* using a finite difference scheme, where both the state and time are discretized. *Central differencing is used for most terms, with forward and backward differencing applied where necessary to maintain stability*.<br/>"
