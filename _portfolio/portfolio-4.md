excerpt: "This project focuses on modeling an investor's decision regarding the optimal time to liquidate a position in a pairs trading portfolio. The strategy involves taking a long position in one stock and an offsetting short position in a cointegrated stock, resulting in a wealth process that is stationary. Assuming the wealth process exhibits a finite number of jumps, the objective is to determine the optimal stopping time for liquidation. To address the challenge of evaluating this stopping time, *numerical methods such as finite differences and quadrature* were employed to solve the associated differential equation.<br/>"
