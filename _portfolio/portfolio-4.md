title: "[Numerical Scheme for the Optimal Stopping Problem for Pairs Trading Under Jump Diffusion Dynamics on High-Frequency Data](https://github.com/kenrickraymond/Optimal-Exit-Problem)"
excerpt: "A mean reversion strategy suggests that asset prices tend to return back to average levels after an extreme price move. A position in pairs trading involves the long position in one stock matches with the offsetting position in another stock that is cointegrated. This results in a portfolio where the wealth process is stationary. Given these conditions, the goal of this project is to model an investor interested in the optimal time to liquidate her position in a pairs trading portfolio under the assumptions that the wealth process exhibits a finite number of jumps. To overcome the intractability of evaluating the optimal stopping time, numerical methods such as finite differences and quadrature were employed to evaluate the associated differential equation.<br/>"
